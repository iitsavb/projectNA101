<h1><i><u>Most asked questions about North Africa</u></i></h1>

<h1><i><font size="5">What countries does North Africa consist of?</font></i></h1>
<p><font size="4">North Africa consists of 5 countries: Morocco, Algeria,Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.<br>
The first three countries are also referred to as the <b>Maghreb</b> since they used to be one country all together.<br>
The people of North Africa are predominantly Muslim and their official languages are arabic and berber.</font></p>

<h1><i><font size="5">What race are North Africans?</font></i></h1>
<p><font size="4"> So in North Africa there are two types of people:<b>The North Africans</b> and <b>the Afro-Arabs.</b>
The original <br>North African inhabitants are North African but due to colonisation of the Arabs in 645 CE, the population has become more diverse.<br>
So it is false to claim that all the people are Arab or North African since most Afro-arabs have some North African in them.

<h1><i><font size="5">Who invented couscous?</font></i></h1>
<p><font size="4">Couscous was invented before <b>Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia</b> split up in their own countries.<br>
It was invented as early as 238 bce indicating that <b> all three of them</b> invented it.</font></p>
